      <description>Shhhh it&amp;rsquo;s a secret&amp;hellip; There are often times we want to incorporate items like passwords or other sensitive data in our code or repositories.

On a standalone Linux host this is pretty straight forward, however managing your cluster nodes is not as easy as logging in and changing the interfaces. OpenShift handles changes on the nodes via machine configs and the machine config operator.</description>
